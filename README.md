# **Full Stack Tracker Project**
_This is our final project on the _nology course and our first full stack prtoject._
_We were challeged to make a full stack project with a database. The data is displayed, added, deleted and updated from the front end website. I decided to make a crochet project tracker._
_I used React, SCSS, JavaScript, Java, SpringBoot, GCP and SQL._
_This is the link to the website https://hope-sugden.github.io/crochet-tracker-frontend/_


## **Main Features**

### When the website first loads it displays all the projects in the database. They are displayed as cards showing the project name, difficulty, dates started & completed and a notes section for any other details. 
### Each project has a delete button which will immediately oe the project from the database. 
### There is also an update button which opens up a modal and allows any data field to be chnaged.
### At the end of the list of pojects there is a button to add a new project.
### In the navbar there is a link to take you straight to the rojects section. 
### There is also a search function in the Navbar which allows you to search by project name.

## **Limitations**

### From the add and update modal, the modal doen't close automatically once the form has been submitted.
### There is no validation on the form so projects can be submitted with empty data fields.
